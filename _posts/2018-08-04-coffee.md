nspired by Matt Buchanan’s [canonical New York guide on The Awl](https://www.theawl.com/2015/07/good-coffee-shops-in-new-york-city/). His disclaimer, which I will repeat verbatim:_

> _Good is obviously a subjective term! Lots of coffee is good, from lots_ _of places, like Waffle House or Dunkin Donuts or your corner deli. But_ _within Fancy Coffee, I think the definition “good” can be narrowed_ _slightly to fall within certain parameters specific to this genre of_ _coffee, which is what this list is about. Of course, you should drink_ _whatever you want because you’re going to die very, very soon and why_ _drink something you don’t like?_

Speciality coffee is pretty much the same everywhere in the world. At some point, the best coffees are going to be pretty similar, and even [most of the spaces end up being repetitive and uninteresting](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification).

My scale:

*   **Very Good** (worth a special trip)
*   **Perfectly Okay** (consistently good and worth a visit if you’re nearby)
*   **No Shame** (not great but if you need coffee, better than what’s probably around you)
*   **Probably Fine** (I’ve not been recently or often enough to have good data but I’ve heard good things, maybe)
*   **Actually Bad** (shops that should be avoided, may be divisive because many have a reputation of being Good)

So again this is subjective. But if you’re reading this, you’re curious enough what I think, so this is my opinion of Good and Bad, do whatever you want with it but probably avoid complaining to me about it. One last note, I usually only drink drip or espresso.

### Very Good Shops

*   Elm (extremely pretentious, one of only 3 roasters in Seattle ever worth drinking along with Kuma and Slate)
*   KEXP/Marzocco (roaster is usually good, space is always cool regardless)
*   Vif (maybe the best shop in the city at this point??)
*   Tougo (prefer drip, their house espresso blend is a bit dark for me)
*   General Porpoise (hours are not great unless you can get into the spheres which i don't recommend for any other reason other than getting coffee at a GP after 3pm)

### Perfectly Okay Shops

*   Anchored Ship
*   Miir (it's very weird but coffee is good)
*   Milstead (prefer espresso, which is a ripoff, and I hate their new space)
*   Mr. West
*   Slate (prefer PS/UD locations, the original Ballard spot is notoriously odd from a service perspective, and their roasting profile is divisive at best)

### No Shame Shops

*   Ada’s
*   Analog
*   Anchorhead (prefer espresso) (demoting on account of shady practices I've been made privy to)
*   Cherry Street (got that Counter Culture now)
*   Craftworks
*   Coffee Works
*   Dorothea
*   Ghost Note (hahaha “a modern, progressive coffee shop” it’s fine)
*   Herkimer
*   Ladro (if you get a light roast it’s fine)
*   Monorail (it’s terrible but the old Italian guy rides his bike around and is adorable but if I’m missing out on weird shit he’s up to please let me know so I can remove this) (there's a new one on westlake I assume is also bad)
*   Royal Drummer
*   Starbucks Roastery (if you are a tourist)
*   Stumptown (I had a terrible shot last week and they sold out, maybe it’s bad now, idk)
*   Victrola
*   Vivace
*   Woodland

### Probably Fine Shops

idk why I never go to these places but

*   Convoy
*   Street Bean
*   Union Coffee

### Actually Bad Shops

*   Caffe Vita (sorry everyone)
*   Dilettante (more like obviously bad)
*   Starbucks (though worth admitting is remarkably consistent and will beat anything else in 90-something percent of the country outside of major cities) (blonde roast is fine, like, get over yourselves, especially in an airport)
*   Storyville
*   Uptown Espresso
*   Umbria
*   Wheelhouse (RIP)
*   Zeitgeist

(and probably every other place not mentioned on this page? worth assuming until proven otherwise)
